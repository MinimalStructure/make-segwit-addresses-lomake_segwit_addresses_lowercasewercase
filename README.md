# make segwit addresses lowercase
I had an issue with Specter Desktop when I scanned a bech32 address from the Samourai Wallet. Specter Desktop scans it to all caps. I wrote this program as a workaround. You just need to copy and paste the address that gets scanned and paste it into the python program. Ideally this will get fixed in Specter Desktop, but I'm still a coding neophyte. Hopefully I can contribute more to the project after learning Flask and object oriented programing.

To use it, you will need to have python3 installed.

To copy an paste it into a linux Comand Line you need to use ctrl + shift c and ctrl + shift v to paste.
